# Self-made Wordle

## Description
Wordle is a word game where the player has to guess a mystery word. The mystery word is predefined by the number of letters and how many there are, as well as how many guesses the player has to guess it. After each player guess, the game shows which letters coincide with the mystery word. If the letter is in the correct spot, it will turn green. If the a letter exists in the mystery word but it is in the wrong spot, it will turn yellow. Otherwise, it will be greyed out. The game ends when the player guesses the word or they run out of guesses.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Usage
Self-made wordle is based on the popular online game by New York Times called "Wordle". In contrast to "Wordle" there are three other game modes Self-made Wordle includes, them being Verticle, Xordle and Nerdle. Links for the original games are all found below.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

### Stack Overflow
- The class used to create the background colors seen on the terminal during gameplay was found in this discussion: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5762491/how-to-print-color-in-console-using-system-out-println/5762502#5762502
- Many occasions in my code use Math.random. To better understand how to use it, the following discussion was read: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/363681/how-do-i-generate-random-integers-within-a-specific-range-in-java
